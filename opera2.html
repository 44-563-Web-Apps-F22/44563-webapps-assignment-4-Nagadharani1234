          <P class="SOL speech">If you ask us how we live,
                 Lovers all essentials giveâ€”
                      We can ride on lovers' sighs,
                      Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,
                      Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,
                      Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,
                      Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,
                      Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.
                 When you know us, you'll discover
                 That we almost live on lover!</P>
                 <p class="direction">(As it commences, the Peers appear at the back, advancing unseen
                    and on tiptoe.  Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller lead Phyllis
                    between them, who listens in horror to what she hears.)</p>
    <h6 class="MOU name">MOU</h6> 
           <p class="MOU speech"> My Lord, I have much pleasure in announcing that
       I have succeeded in inducing the young person to present herself at
       the Bar of this House.
           </P>
           <p class="direction">(to Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller)</p>
       
     <h6 class="MOU name">MOU.</h6>
          <p class="MOU speech">

           Though the views of the House have diverged
               On every conceivable motion,
           All questions of Party are merged
               In a frenzy of love and devotion;
           If you ask us distinctly to say
               What Party we claim to belong to,
           We reply, without doubt or delay,
                The Party I'm singing this song to!
          </P>
          <p class="direction">(Fairies threaten Peers with their wands.  Peers kneel as begging
               for merry.  Phyllis implores Strephon to relent.  He casts her from
               him, and she falls fainting into the arms of Lord Mountararat and
               Lord Tolloller.)
