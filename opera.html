    <h5>ACT 1 SCENE.—An Arcadian Landscape.  A river runs around the back of the
        stage.  A rustic bridge crosses the river.</h5>
        
     <h6>S0L</h6>
          <p>We are dainty little fairies,
            Ever singing, ever dancing;
        We indulge in our vagaries
            In a fashion most entrancing.
       If you ask the special function
            Of our never-ceasing motion,
       We reply, without compunction,
            That we haven't any notion!</P>
        
     <h6>CHO</h6>
          <p>  No, we haven't any notion!
            Tripping hither, etc.</P>
        
     <h6>SOL</h6>
          <P>If you ask us how we live,
                 Lovers all essentials give—
                      We can ride on lovers' sighs,
                      Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,
                      Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,
                      Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,
                      Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,
                      Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.
                 When you know us, you'll discover
                 That we almost live on lover!</P>
        
     <h6> STR</h6>

          <p>  Good morrow, good mother!
                      Good mother, good morrow!
                 By some means or other,
                      Pray banish your sorrow!
                           With joy beyond telling
                           My bosom is swelling,
                           So join in a measure
                           Expressive of pleasure,
                 For I'm to be married to-day—to-day—
                      Yes, I'm to be married to-day!
         </P>
        
     <h6> CHA</h6>
           <p>
                        The Law is the true embodiment
                        Of everything that's excellent.
                        It has no kind of fault or flaw,
                        And I, my Lords, embody the Law.
                        The constitutional guardian I
                        Of pretty young Wards in Chancery,
                        All very agreeable girls—and none
                        Are over the age of twenty-one.
                             A pleasant occupation for
                             A rather susceptible Chancellor!
          </P>
        

     <h6>MOU</h6> 
           <p> My Lord, I have much pleasure in announcing that
       I have succeeded in inducing the young person to present herself at
       the Bar of this House.
           </P>
       
     <h6>MOU.</h6>
           <p>

        Though the views of the House have diverged
             On every conceivable motion,
        All questions of Party are merged
             In a frenzy of love and devotion;
        If you ask us distinctly to say
             What Party we claim to belong to,
        We reply, without doubt or delay,
             The Party I'm singing this song to!
        </P>
