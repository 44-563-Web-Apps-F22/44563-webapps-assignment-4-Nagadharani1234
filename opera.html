               We are dainty little fairies,
                    Ever singing, ever dancing;
               We indulge in our vagaries
                    In a fashion most entrancing.
               If you ask the special function
                    Of our never-ceasing motion,
               We reply, without compunction,
                    That we haven't any notion!
          </P>

               No, we haven't any notion!
                    Tripping hither, etc.

          <P class="SOL speech">If you ask us how we live,
                 Lovers all essentials give—
                      We can ride on lovers' sighs,
                      Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,
                      Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,
                      Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,
                      Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,
                      Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.
                 When you know us, you'll discover
                 That we almost live on lover!</P>

                    and on tiptoe.  Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller lead Phyllis
                    between them, who listens in horror to what she hears.)</p>

               By some means or other,
                      Pray banish your sorrow!
                           With joy beyond telling
                           My bosom is swelling,
                           So join in a measure
                           Expressive of pleasure,
               For I'm to be married to-day—to-day—
                      Yes, I'm to be married to-day!

                        The Law is the true embodiment
                        Of everything that's excellent.
                        It has no kind of fault or flaw,
                        And I, my Lords, embody the Law.

                        Are over the age of twenty-one.
                             A pleasant occupation for
                             A rather susceptible Chancellor!

               On every conceivable motion,
           All questions of Party are merged
               In a frenzy of love and devotion;
           If you ask us distinctly to say
               What Party we claim to belong to,
           We reply, without doubt or delay,
                The Party I'm singing this song to!
